## URPSA (Unbiased Reaction Path Search Algorithm)

URPSA is an algorithm that uses to find multiple reaction pathways of n number of molecular fragments. The algorithm finds reaction pathways by closing molecular fragments with different orientations and looking at the new product formations and energy barriers in various orientations.

Python language is used to script the algorithm and the environment,  third-party apps are used to calculate ab initio calculations.
